Dear Jack,

Unfortunately they give only the reflections of both sides and not Transmission values. First order 
transmission should be the 100% subtracting the two Fresnel reflections of the 2 surfaces …assuming 
there is no absorption and that the surfaces are parallel.  Unfortunately the 2 surface of the Chromatic 
corrector are not parallel. 

We faced the same problem with the condenser lenses see mail below (7/9/2022):

Dear John and Antonio, 
AR coatings are finished. Result on the PLANO CONVEX lenses and the witness sample (flat Suprasil disc) 
do correspond to what I have presented to you. Unfortunately this is not the case for the condenser 
lenses. TRM in the UV range is less enhanced. I attached the corresponding plots. We always learn new 
things. The AR calculation I can do with my software is apparently valid only for parallel surface 
substrates. The condense lenses do behave different. Looks to me that the light angle in the backside AR 
layer is bigger due to the not parallel surfaces … light is traveling longer and the magic ¼ wavelength 
enhancement is shifting to the visible. 
_________________________
Hope this information is useful. One could measure TRM of the lens with our integration Sphere setup. 
But I fear the object is too big and on top not available for measurement any more ( installed)

Kind Regards 
Thomas

Dear Thomas, 

Sorry to bother you but I wondered if you help me with a question. In the attached data sheet, the 
reflectivity of the two faces of the CEDAR Chromatic Corrector is given.
Now is this the Transmission of the coatings? Or Is it the reflectivity’s only and doesn’t take into account 
the transmission through the coatings? 

Any Help would be great!

Many Thanks
Jack
